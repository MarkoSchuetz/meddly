<h2>New in this branch</h2>

<h3>Simple interface</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Added <tt>const</tt> to array of terminal values,
       in parameter to <tt>createEdgeForVar</tt> methods.
       This should have minimal, if any, impact on applications.
  </li>

  <li> <b>Removed</b> <tt>const</tt> from arrays in parameters
       to <tt>createEdge</tt> methods, as the implementation will
       now reorder these arrays in place as needed for speed.
       If you expect these arrays to remain untouched, then you
       will need to copy them before calling the method.
  </li>

  <li> Added <tt>forest</tt> constants <tt>DONT_CARE</tt>
       and <tt>DONT_CHANGE</tt>,
       which should be used instead of raw values,
       for calls to <tt>createEdge()</tt> methods.
  </li>
</ul>
