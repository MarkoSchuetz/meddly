<h2>Repository updates since last release</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added <tt>typedef</tt>s for node handles and addresses,
     updated the interface and code to use these.
</li>

<li> Switched to one pool of nodes per forest,
     instead of one pool per level.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>SIMPLE INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The forest policy for specifying full vs sparse node storage has changed.
     Now, this is specified via <tt>storage_flags</tt>
     by combining flags <tt>ALLOW_FULL_STORAGE</tt>
     and <tt>ALLOW_SPARSE_STORAGE</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
<li>  The node storage scheme may be changed on a per forest basis,
      at runtime, by setting the forest <tt>policy</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>EXPERT INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The node storage interface has changed.
     This is likely to affect forest implementations, and not much else.
</li>
<li>  Different node storage schemes are implemented in the
      <tt>storage</tt> subdirectory.
      Motivated users may invent and use their own schemes.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Still to do or next steps</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Finish design of arbitrary node storage mechanisms.
</li>

<li>  Better handling of edge values in nodes 
      i.e., really treat an edge value as a chunk of memory,
      and concatenate the chunks when storing a node.
</li>

<li>  Decide on a scheme for hashing the (now) raw chunks
      of data in an edge value, and hashed headers.
</li>

</ul>
