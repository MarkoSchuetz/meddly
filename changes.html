<h2>Repository updates since last release</h2>

<ul>
<li> Changing node handles from <tt>int</tt>
     to <tt>long</tt> everywhere in the interface
</li>
<li> Experimenting with one pool of nodes per forest,
     instead of one pool per level.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Still to do or next steps</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Support arbitrary node storage mechanisms.
      Abstract base class with derived classes for
      different storage schemes.
      Factory class inside forest "policy" to
      specify the node storage mechanism
      (this allows user-defined storage!)
</li>

<li> Support <tt>long</tt> node handles
     in unique tables
</li>

<li> Support <tt>long</tt> node handles
     in compute tables
</li>

<li> Use compaction in compute tables.
     Idea: entries of shorts, ints, and longs.
     May need abstraction in the interface for this.
</li>

</ul>
