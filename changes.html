<h2>Repository updates since last release</h2>

<ul>
<li> Changing node handles from <tt>int</tt>
     to <tt>long</tt> everywhere in the interface
</li>
<li> Experimenting with one pool of nodes per forest,
     instead of one pool per level.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>SIMPLE INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The forest policy for specifying full vs sparse node storage has changed.
     Now, this is specified via <tt>storage_flags</tt>
     by combining flags <tt>ALLOW_FULL_STORAGE</tt>
     and <tt>ALLOW_SPARSE_STORAGE</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
<li>  The node storage scheme may be changed on a per forest basis,
      at runtime, by setting the forest <tt>policy</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>EXPERT INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The node storage interface has changed.
     This is likely to affect forest implementations, and not much else.
</li>
<li>  Different node storage schemes are implemented in the
      <tt>storage</tt> subdirectory.
      Motivated users may invent and use their own schemes.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Still to do or next steps</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Finish design of arbitrary node storage mechanisms.
</li>

<li> Support <tt>long</tt> node handles
     in unique tables
</li>

<li> Support <tt>long</tt> node handles
     in compute tables
</li>

<li> Use compaction in compute tables.
     Idea: entries of shorts, ints, and longs.
     May need abstraction in the interface for this.
</li>

</ul>
