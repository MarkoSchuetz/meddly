<h2>Repository updates since last release</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added <tt>typedef</tt>s for node handles and addresses,
     updated the interface and code to use these.
</li>

<li> Switched to one pool of nodes per forest,
     instead of one pool per level.
</li>

<li> Changed free list representation for node handles.
</li>

<li>  The node storage mechanism is now loosely coupled,
      and may be selected at runtime.
</li>

<li>  The node memory recycling mechanism is now loosely coupled.
      There are a few mechanisms to choose from.
</li>

<li>  Added a new node storage mechanism that uses compression.
</li>

<li>  Added ability to read and write DDs to a file.

</ul>

<h4>SIMPLE INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The forest policy for specifying full vs sparse node storage has changed.
     Now, this is specified via <tt>storage_flags</tt>
     by combining flags <tt>ALLOW_FULL_STORAGE</tt>
     and <tt>ALLOW_SPARSE_STORAGE</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
<li>  The node storage scheme may be changed on a per forest basis,
      at runtime, by setting the forest <tt>policy</tt> as appropriate.
</li>
<li>
      Removed forest policy <tt>recycleNodeStorageHoles</tt>,
      since the new policy <tt>nodestor</tt> 
      allows to specify how nodes are stored and how holes are
      tracked (if at all).
</li>
<li>  In the <tt>forest</tt> class, added methods
  <ul>
  <li>  <tt>writeEdges</tt>, to write one or more edges
        (and all nodes below) to a file in a machine readable format
  </li>
  <li>  <tt>readEdges</tt>, to read one or more edges
        (and all nodes below) from a file
  </li>
  </ul> 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>EXPERT INTERFACE CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li> The node storage interface has changed.
     This is likely to affect forest implementations, and not much else.
</li>
<li>  Different node storage schemes are implemented in the
      <tt>storage</tt> subdirectory.
      Motivated users may invent and use their own schemes.
</li>
<li>  In the <tt>expert_forest</tt> class, method <tt>reportMemoryUsage</tt>
      has been replaced by method <tt>reportStats</tt>.
</li>
<li>  <tt>expert_forest::markNodesInSubgraph</tt> and
      <tt>expert_forest::showNodeGraph</tt>
      now take an array of root nodes, instead of a single one.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Still to do or next steps</h2>

<ul>

<li>  Better handling of edge values in nodes 
      i.e., really treat an edge value as a chunk of memory,
      and concatenate the chunks when storing a node.
</li>

<li>  Decide on a scheme for hashing the (now) raw chunks
      of data in an edge value, and hashed headers.
</li>

</ul>
