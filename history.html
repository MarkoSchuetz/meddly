<h1 id="hometitle">Version History</h1>

<h2>Repository updates since last release</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Improved documentation generation (automatically updates library version number).
</li>
<li>  Added complete technical documentation under a new <tt>docs-devel</tt> directory.
</li>
<li>  Reorganized forest class hierarchy.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.7.254 (2011 July 15)</h2>

<ul>
<li>  No changes to the simple interface.
</li>
<li>  The compute table class is now visible in the expert interface.
      This should allow operations to be defined outside the library
      and still use the built-in compute tables.
</li>
<li>  The compute table mechanism has been redesigned
      and reimplemented.
      The compute table interface has changed significantly;
      this will affect anyone who implements their own operations.
</li>
<li>  Different compute tables may be selected at library
      initialization time.
</li>
<li>  Some of the globally visible functions and macros
      have been renamed or moved into the MEDDLY namespace
      to avoid conflicts.
</li>
<li>  Several example applications run faster now.
      This resolves the known issue under version 0.6.233.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.6.233 (2011 July 05)</h2>

<h4>CHANGES TO THE SIMPLE INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>
<li>  The compute manager class has been removed; 
      all its functionality has been moved to
      the <tt>MEDDLY</tt> namespace.
      For example, the old code segment
      <pre>
      compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
      CM->apply(compute_manager::UNION, x, y, z);
      </pre>
      can be replaced by
      <pre>
      apply(UNION, x, y, z);
      </pre>
</li>
<li>  The types of the operation codes (e.g., <tt>UNION</tt>)
      have changed.
      Most applications should not be affected by this;
      however, the change <em>is</em> visible to the simple interface.
</li>
<li>  A call to <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup()</tt> will automatically
      destroy any remaining domains, forests, or other objects
      created by MEDDLY.
      (This <em>known issue</em> listed under version 0.5
      seems to be resolved.)
</li>
<li>  A few operation names have changed: 
      old <tt>MIN</tt> is now <tt>MINIMUM</tt>
      and old <tt>MAX</tt> is now <tt>MAXIMUM</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>CHANGES TO THE EXPERT INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Operation codes are now classes instead of an enumerated type.
      Each operation knows its own name and how to build an operation
      for specified forests (more on that, below).
</li>
<li>  The old <tt>operation</tt> and <tt>op_info</tt> classes
      have been merged together into a new <tt>operation</tt> class.
      Each instance of <tt>operation</tt> is tied to specific forests.
</li>
<li>  There are <tt>operation</tt> subclasses for unary, binary, 
      and numerical operations.
      A numerical operation is tied to specific forest <em>edges</em>.
</li>
<li>  Numerical operations have moved to the expert interface,
      and are accessed as follows.
      Old code:
      <pre>
        // preprocessing
        compute_manager* CM = getComputeManager();
        // ...
        // critical
        CM->vectorMatrixMultiply(y, y_ind, x, x_ind, A);
      </pre>
      New code:
      <pre>
        // preprocessing
        numerical_operation* VM = VECT_MATR_MULT->buildOperation(y_ind, A, x_ind);
        // ...
        // critical
        VM->compute(y, x);
      </pre>
</li>
<li>  Users may define their own operations in user space,
      and initialize them with the same mechanism as the
      built-in operations.
      To do this:
      <ol>
      <li> Derive a class from <tt>op_initializer</tt>
           and implement the required virtual functions.  </li>
      <li> Insert your initializer into the instance of
            <tt>settings</tt> used to initialize the library.
            If you want to initialize the builtin operations,
            you should use something like <pre>
          MEDDLY::settings s;
          s.operationBuilder = new my_initializer(s.operationBuilder);
          MEDDLY::initialize(s);
          </pre>
      </li>
      <li> Your initializer's <tt>initChain</tt>
           method will be called during the call to
           <tt>MEDDLY::initialize(s);</tt>
      </li>
      <li>  Your initializer's <tt>cleanupChain</tt>
            method will ne called during the call to
            <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup();</tt>
      </li>
      </ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>KNOWN ISSUES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  The current compute table is not as fast as the old one for some operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.5.186 (2011 June 16)</h2>

<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Variables in domains are represented by
      instances of class <tt>variable</tt>, instead of integers.
      The same variable may appear in more than one domain.
</li>

<li>  Domain levels are always in the order: topmost, &hellip;, 2, 1, 0
      where level 0 is for terminal nodes.
      As such, level mapping is no longer necessary.
</li>

<li>  For convenience, there is a new function
      <pre>
      MEDDLY::createDomainBottomUp(&hellip;)
      </pre>
      which combines domain creation and variable initialization.
</li>

<li>  There are new functions to destroy objects,
      <pre>
      MEDDLY::destroyDomain(&hellip;)
      MEDDLY::destroyForest(&hellip;)
      </pre>
      and these must be used instead of <tt>delete</tt>.
</li>

</ul>
<h4>DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS</h4>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Now deprecated</th>
  <th>Equivalent replacement</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>domain::getTopVariable()</tt></td>
  <td align="center"><tt>domain::getNumVariables()</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>domain::getVariableAbove(v)</tt></td>
  <td align="center"><tt>v+1</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>domain::getVariableBelow(v)</tt></td>
  <td align="center"><tt>v-1</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>expert_domain::getVariableHeight(v)</tt></td>
  <td align="center"><tt>v</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>expert_domain::getVariableWithHeight(h)</tt></td>
  <td align="center"><tt>h</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>KNOWN ISSUES</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Calling <tt>MEDDLY::cleanup()</tt> can sometimes cause 
      a segmentation fault.
      Destroying all domains before calling <tt>cleanup()</tt>
      seems to fix this.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.4.174 (2011 June 13)</h2>
<h4>CHANGES TO THE SIMPLE INTERFACE</h4>
<ul>

<li> Functions and classes are now contained in a <tt>MEDDLY</tt> 
namespace. 
</li>
<br>
<li> Top-level functions named <tt>MEDDLY_function</tt> 
have been renamed as <tt>function</tt>.  
For example,
<tt>
MEDDLY_createDomain()
</tt>
can now be called as
<tt>
MEDDLY::createDomain()</tt>,
or as
<tt>
createDomain()
</tt>
inside a <tt>using namespace MEDDLY</tt> block.
</li>
<br>
<li>
There is a single, centralized <tt>error</tt> class.
All methods that previously returned <tt>error</tt>
now return <tt>void</tt>,
and any errors are passed back to the user using <tt>throw</tt>.
For example, the old code fragment
<pre>
  domain::error e = dom-&gt;createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  if (e != domain::SUCCESS) { 
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: %s\n&quot;, domain::getErrorCodeName(e)); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
</pre>
now becomes
<pre>
  try { 
    dom-&gt;createVariablesBottomUp(vars, N); 
  } 
  catch (MEDDLY::error e) { 
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: %s\n&quot;, e.getName()); 
    exit(1); 
  } 
</pre>
</li>

<li> The library must be initialized before use.
(Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error, otherwise.)
This can be done via 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::initialize(); 
</pre>
</tt><br>
which uses default settings.
To use different settings: 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::settings s; 
  // change members of s here; 
  // the constructor will fill everything with default values so 
  // it is only necessary to specify the non-default values. 
  MEDDLY::initialize(s); <br>
</pre>
</li>

<li> <tt>compute_manager::setHashTablePolicy()</tt> has been
removed, as this functionality is now provided using the appropriate
settings during library initialization.
</li>
<br>
<li> Library memory may be released using 
<pre>
  MEDDLY::cleanup(); 
</pre>
Most operations will fail and throw an appropriate error after
<tt>cleanup()</tt> is called.
If desired, the library may be initialized again.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>New in version 0.3.165 (2011 June 08)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Added row-wise and column-wise iterators for Matrix Diagrams.</li>
<li> Iterators can now return the terminal value of the corresponding
minterm.</li>
<br>
<li> Added (basic) vector matrix multiplication operations.</li>
<br>
<li> Improved batch addition of minterms based on Radix Sort (speed).</li>
<li> Added mechanism for building temporary nodes.</li>
<li> Added another option for batch addition of minterms based on
temporary nodes.</li>
<br>
<li> Added reverse reachability (all states that can reach a given set of
states using a given next-state function).</li>
<li> Added the traditional reachability algorithm and a saturation-based
algorithm for reverse reachability.</li>
<br>
<li> Added test directory and files for <tt>make check</tt>.</li>
<li> Reorganization of source files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.2.101 (2010 June 11)</h2>
<ul>
<li>First tarball release</li>
<li>CTL model checking functionality is complete
(some advanced features are still in development)
</ul>
