To create a branch or a tag: copy the entire "trunk" subdirectory to
an appropriately-named subdirectory at the same level.

Subdirectories:

docs/     Generated docs from source code
examples/ Stand-alone applications that use the library
src/      Library source code

Instructions for library users:

Build the library:
0. Need to have g++ installed (may also need autoconf, automake and libtool).
1. $ ./configure
   This will setup the build files.
   An alternate would be:
   $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD
   (See "make install" further down for the reason).
2. $ make
   Build the library.
   Library will be in src/. Applications in src/ and examples/. This may be
   sufficient for most users.
3. $ make install
   Library in /usr/lib/. Applications in /usr/bin/. This can be changed
   in step (1) by selecting an alternate location. If you reconfigure,
   make sure you run "make clean" before running "make".
4. $ make uninstall
   Removes the files installed in bin/ and lib/.
5. $ make clean
   Removes the results of compilation from src/ and examples/.

Documentation:
0. Need to have doxygen installed.
1. $ cd docs
2. If you see docs/html/index.html and docs/refman.pdf, your docs have
   already been built and you can ignore the rest of the steps. Otherwise:
   $ make
   This will create the folders docs/html and docs/latex.
   docs/html: HTML documentation. See index.html.
   docs/latex: Tex-based documentation. See refman.tex.
     If you have latex installed:
     a. $ cd latex
     b. $ make
        This will create refman.dvi.
     c. $ make pdf
        This will create refman.pdf (using ps2pdf).
3. $ make clean
   Removes docs/ and html/.

Maintainers:
You will need autoconf, automake and libtool to build the configure script
from configure.ac and relevant Makefiles from Makefile.am. Once you have
these packages:
1. You should have autogen.sh in this folder.
2. $ ./autogen.sh
   This will create the configure script and Makefiles.
3. $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD
4. $ make
   This will compile the sources in src/ and examples/. It will also
   create applications in src/ and examples/.
5. $ make install
   This will install the Mdd library in lib/ and applications from src/
   and examples/ in bin/.
6. $ make uninstall
   Removes the files installed in bin/ and lib/.
7. $ make clean
   Removes the results of compilation from src/ and examples/.
