	* Moving MDD library to sourceforge.net (previously known as MddLib and
		stored on the svn server at pyrite@cs.iastate.edu).

	* bootstrap renamed to autogen.sh.
	* autogen.sh runs libtoolize before automake.
	* autogen.sh does not run configure as the last step.
	* configure.ac created using autoscan on include/, src/ and examples/.

	* Replaced #if checks with #ifdef checks (src/defines.h).
