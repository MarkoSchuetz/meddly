Preferred mechanism for disruptive library changes: branching.


MAKE A BRANCH:

(0) Copy the trunk into a new subdirectory under branches:

    $ svn copy url:for/trunk  url:for/branches/mybranch


(1) svn update to get the branch


MERGE A BRANCH BACK:

(0) Merge any trunk changes into the branch.  Inside the branch:

    $ svn merge url:for/trunk


(1) Build and test; resolve any issues

(2) Commit changes (svn commit)


(3) Change to trunk working copy

(4) svn update (should be nothing)

(5) svn merge --reintegrate  url:for/branches/mybranch

(6) Build and test; resolve any issues

(7) Commit changes (svn commit)

(8) Delete the branch:

    $ svn delete url:for/branches/mybranch
